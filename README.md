# K-Means

This project was located on kaggle. This demonstrates my understanding of basic k-means clustering. I did find the exercise useful to review the basics; however, I am not fond of the ineffieciencies found throughout the code. This could have been completed much faster/better using scikit learn. Overall, it was okay for a learning experience, but I would not implement this in industry. The goal of this project was to segment mall customers based on age and annual income using unsupervised learning. The result were clusters that completed this objective.
